# FIFA-World-Cup-Analytics

1. Created a Power BI Dashboard that highlights the statistics of the FIFA World Cup held between 1930-2014. The statistics indluded Winners, Attendance, Referres, Goals Scored, etc.

2. Started by cleaning and filtering the data using ETL(Extract, Transform, Load).

3. Used Power Query Editor to first create a new table called Participants. The next step was to append the initial table columns in the new table. Finally, removed the unnecessary columns and unpivoted the remaining columns.

4. Used DAX functions such as SUM() while creating measures to achieve the desired result.
